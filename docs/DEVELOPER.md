# Developer guide — Supertext Translation for AtroPIM

An AtroCore module (Composer package `supertext/atropim-supertext-translation`, AtroCore module id and PHP namespace `SupertextTranslation`). It works in every AtroCore application; AtroPIM is the one it is built and tested for.

## Architecture

AtroCore loads a module through `composer.json` → `extra.atroId`: the class `\SupertextTranslation\Module` and everything below `app/` by convention.

| Part | Files | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module | `app/Module.php` | Load order (after AtroPIM) and the console commands. |
| Action type | `app/ActionTypes/SupertextTranslate.php`, `app/Resources/metadata/action/types.json` | The action type `supertextTranslate`. AtroCore's action framework provides the record button, the mass action, background jobs (*Execute in background*), *Execute as*, conditions and the execution log; `execute()` translates one record (mass actions call it once per record) and writes the summary to the execution and its log. |
| Action routes | `app/Handlers/Action/SupertextTranslate{,Async}Handler.php` | `POST /api/Action/{id}/supertextTranslate` and `…Async`, the URLs AtroCore's front end calls for an action type. |
| Action options | `app/Resources/metadata/entityDefs/Action.json`, `app/Listeners/ActionLayout.php`, `app/Listeners/Metadata.php` | Real columns on `action` (`supertext_connection_id`, `supertext_source_language`, `supertext_target_languages`, `supertext_overwrite`, `supertext_politeness`), visible for this type only; the layout listener adds them to the form, the metadata listener fills the language options from the configured languages. |
| Connection type | `app/ConnectionType/ConnectionSupertext.php`, `app/Resources/metadata/app/connectionTypes.json`, `entityDefs/Connection.json`, `app/Listeners/ConnectionLayout.php` | Connection type `supertext`, the module's settings page: API key (a `password` field, encrypted by AtroCore), environment, URL, timeout, the language mapping (one `enum` field per AtroCore language, `supertextCode<Language>`, see *Language codes*), *Send version information to Supertext* (`supertextVersionReports`, bool, default on) and the read-only `supertextKeyCheck` / `supertextLanguageStatus`, all stored in the connection's `data` JSON (`dataField`). *Test connection* runs the reporter's key check (see *Commando Center*). |
| Language mapping | `app/Translation/LanguageMapping.php`, `app/Listeners/Metadata.php`, `Language.php`, `ConnectionLayout.php` | The combo boxes of the connection: field definitions, labels (`Language` listener, event `Language` → `modify`: label, tooltip and option names per interface language, from `Connection.json` → `labels`), form rows, the server-side check and the migration of the old text field (no AtroCore classes in `LanguageMapping`: `tests/unit/LanguageMappingTest.php`). |
| Connection events | `app/Listeners/ConnectionService.php`, `app/Translation/ConnectionStatus.php` | `afterReadEntity`: moves lines of the old text mapping into the combo boxes (saved once), shows each empty combo box with its suggestion, fills the two read-only fields in the viewer's language, then the reporter's `onRequest` after the response; `afterCreateEntity`/`afterUpdateEntity`: `afterSettingsSaved` (key check, report), then stores both fields (`saveEntity(…, ['skipAll' => true])`: no hooks, no history) so the form shows the result at once; `before…Entity` drops the read-only fields from incoming data and refuses a combo box value that isn't one of Supertext's codes (`invalid_language_code`); `after…Entity` also runs the migration. |
| Commando Center | `app/Translation/Reporting.php`, `ReportingFactory.php`, `app/Handlers/Supertext/PingHandler.php` | Version reports, the automatic API key check and the public ping `GET /api/supertext/ping` (see *Commando Center*). |
| Result message | `app/Listeners/ActionService.php` | `afterExecuteNow`: replaces AtroCore's "Action … was executed" with the summary ("de_CH, fr_CH: translated (4 fields)", or counts for a mass action); for the file action types it adds the result's `link` (download, upload page). |
| Translation | `app/Translation/EntityTranslator.php` | Loads the record through its record service, plans, sends one HTML document per target language, saves with the record service's `updateEntity()` (ACL, validation, hooks, history). |
| Planning | `app/Translation/Planner.php`, `TextUnit.php` | Which fields are translated (no AtroCore classes: unit-tested). |
| Settings | `app/Translation/Settings.php`, `ConnectionResolver.php` | Connection data → API key, base URL, timeout, language mapping (Supertext codes through the SDK's `Languages`), the reporting setting; `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` / `SUPERTEXT_API_URL` fallbacks. |
| Translation files | `app/ActionTypes/SupertextExport.php`, `SupertextImport.php`, `app/Handlers/Supertext/ExportHandler.php`, `ImportHandler.php`, `app/Translation/TranslationFileExchange.php`, `RecordSource.php`, `AtroRecordSource.php`, `ImportPage.php` | *Export for translation* / *Import translation* (XLIFF 1.2 and HTML files, SDK `TranslationFiles`; see *Translation files*). |
| Console | `app/Console/Check.php`, `Translate.php`, `Export.php`, `Import.php`, `app/Translation/CommandArguments.php` | `supertext check`, `supertext translate <args>`, `supertext export <args>`, `supertext import <args>`. |
| API client | `app/Api/` | Wrapper around the Supertext SDK (`SupertextClient`, `CallableTransport`) and the exception (no AtroCore classes: unit-tested) |
| Supertext SDK | `lib/supertext-sdk/` | Bundled copy of the Supertext PHP SDK, namespace `SupertextTranslation\Sdk` (API classes in `SupertextTranslation\Sdk\V1`; see *Supertext SDK*) |
| Supertext Plugin Health | `lib/supertext-plugin-health/` | Bundled copy of Supertext Plugin Health (the Commando Center reporter), namespace `SupertextTranslation\PluginHealth` (see *Supertext Plugin Health*) |
| Translations | `app/Resources/i18n/{en_US,de_DE,fr_FR,it_IT}/` | Labels, options and tooltips of the new fields (`Action.json`, `Connection.json`) and the messages editors see (`Action.json` → `messages`, keys `supertext…`). |
| Messages | `app/Translation/Messages.php` | Messages in the user's language through AtroCore's `language` service (`Messages::forUser()`), falling back to the English file; `{name}` placeholders. `SupertextException` carries a key, params and Supertext's untranslated detail; the console uses English (`new Messages()`). No AtroCore classes. |

### Field rules

`Planner::units()` decides what is translated (keep [USER_GUIDE.md → What is translated](USER_GUIDE.md#what-is-translated) in sync):

- AtroCore stores a multilingual field as a base field in the main language (`name`) plus one field per additional language (`nameDeCh`) with `multilangField: name` and `multilangLocale: de_CH`. Attribute values follow the same model; `EntityTranslator` merges the entity's own `entityDefs` (where the attribute fields are) into the metadata field definitions.
- Translated: base fields with `isMultilang` of type `varchar`, `text`, `markdown` (plain text) and `wysiwyg` (HTML) that have at least one language sibling.
- Skipped: `readOnly`, `disabled`, `notStorable` and `emHidden` fields; every other type.
- A target field with text (after removing tags and whitespace) is kept unless *overwrite* is set.
- Plain text is sent HTML-escaped with line breaks as `<br>`; rich text as is. Each field is one `data-st-id` element (whole sentences), so formatting inside a paragraph stays inline.
- Plain-text translations longer than the field's `maxLength` are not saved (named in the message); the rest is saved in one `updateEntity()` per language. `NotModified` (the record already has exactly this text) counts as success.

## Supertext API protocol

Shared with the WordPress plugin and every other Supertext plugin:

1. `POST {base}translate/ai/file`: multipart with `file` (part `Content-Type` exactly `text/html`, no charset, or the API answers 415), `target_lang` (a Supertext target code, e.g. `de-CH` or `es`), optional `source_lang` (bare language, e.g. `en`); see *Language codes*, optional `politeness` (`more`/`less`, only for targets that offer it). Returns `{file_id}`.
2. `GET …/{file_id}/status` until `done` (`error`, `limit_exceeded`, `deleted` are terminal).
3. `GET …/{file_id}/translation` returns the translated HTML.
4. `DELETE …/{file_id}` (files also expire after 24 h).

Auth header: `Authorization: Supertext-Auth-Key <key>`. The header name must be `Authorization` (`Authentication` gets 403). Supertext shows the key with the prefix, so the client strips a pasted `Supertext-Auth-Key ` and always sends exactly one. Base URLs: `https://api.supertext.com/v1/` (live), `https://api.staging.supertext.com/v1/`, `https://api.testing.supertext.com/v1/`. `GET features` is the cost-free key check (*Test connection*, `supertext check`).

**Rate limit:** the API limits requests per second per key (HTTP 429). The client retries a 429 up to 4 times, waiting for `Retry-After` if sent, otherwise 1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds plus jitter. Target languages are translated one after the other.

Language codes: see *Language codes* (the connection's mapping, else an exact Supertext code, else the SDK's default target, else `unsupported_language`).

## Supertext SDK

The protocol above, the retries, the list of Supertext languages, the API key check and the `data-st-id` document come from the official Supertext PHP SDK ([Supertext/Supertext-API-SDK-and-Guide](https://github.com/Supertext/Supertext-API-SDK-and-Guide)). The module ships a copy in `lib/supertext-sdk/` with its namespace changed from `Supertext\Sdk` to `SupertextTranslation\Sdk` (Composer autoloads it from the module's `composer.json`; `tests/bootstrap.php` and `tests/phpstan-bootstrap.php` too), so sites install nothing extra and another package that requires the SDK itself can't clash with it. HTTP goes through the SDK's `CurlTransport` (ext-curl, which AtroCore requires anyway; proxy environment variables apply). `lib/supertext-sdk/COMMIT` names the SDK revision.

- Since SDK 0.2.0 everything that talks to the API is in the namespace of its API version, `SupertextTranslation\Sdk\V1` (`src/V1/`); only the HTTP transport (`…\Sdk\Http`) and `…\Sdk\Supertext::SDK_VERSION` are version-neutral. The vendor script copies `src/` with its subfolders and rewrites every `Supertext\Sdk\` prefix, `V1` included.
- Never edit `lib/supertext-sdk/`. Fix the SDK in its repository, then run `scripts/vendor-sdk.sh [ref]` (default `main`; `SDK_DIR=/path/to/clone` uses a local clone) and the tests.
- `app/Api/SupertextClient.php` keeps the module's interface (`translateDocument`, `translateSegments`, `validateApiKey`; a transport or a fake callable) and turns every SDK error code into a `SupertextException` with a `key` (`KEYS`) and `params`; `Translation\Messages` shows the key's text. A new SDK error code needs a key there and its `supertext…` text in all four `i18n/*/Action.json`.
- The SDK provides the client and the API key check (`Client::checkApiKey()`, `Protocol::apiKeyFingerprint()`, `Supertext::SDK_VERSION`); since SDK 0.3.0 the version reports are [Supertext Plugin Health](#supertext-plugin-health)'s.
- The translation files (`SupertextTranslation\Sdk\Files`, SDK 0.5.0) are not tied to an API version and never call the API (see *Translation files*); the vendor script's namespace rewrite covers them like `V1`.
- PHPStan analyses `app/` only; the SDK and Plugin Health have their own checks in their repositories.
- Segments missing from Supertext's answer are left untouched.
- The live API answers an unknown language (`xx-YY`) with HTTP 404 `INVALID_LANGUAGE_PAIR`; the SDK reports it as `invalid_language_pair` with both codes (message `supertextInvalidLanguagePair`). A language without a Supertext code never reaches the API: `Languages::target()`/`source()` throw `unsupported_language` (message `supertextUnsupportedLanguage`, with `{language}`); a tone the target doesn't offer comes back as `unsupported_feature` (`supertextUnsupportedFeature`).

## Translation files

*Export for translation* and *Import translation*: a record's multilingual texts as an XLIFF 1.2 or HTML file, translated outside the API (a CAT tool, a translator, Supertext's web app), and the translated file written back. The file formats, checksums and the safety checks of imported files are the SDK's `SupertextTranslation\Sdk\Files\TranslationFiles` (SDK 0.5.0, integration guide → *Translation files: XLIFF and HTML*); the module only collects, finds and writes back.

- **Core** (`app/Translation/TranslationFileExchange.php`, no AtroCore classes, `tests/unit/TranslationFileExchangeTest.php`): `export()` builds one SDK `FileJob` per target language from exactly what an API translation sends (`Planner::units()` + `Planner::plan()`, so existing target texts are left out unless *overwrite*), segment key = the unit's base field name (`name`, `longDescription`, attribute value fields), plain text as plain segments and `wysiwyg` as HTML. `import()` refuses files over 10,000,000 bytes, `read()`s the file, and per job checks `plugin` (`AtroPIM-Supertext-Translation`, else *other system*), parses `reference` (else *not found*), checks both languages exist (`inputLanguageList`), loads the record (not found / not readable → *not found*; not editable → *not allowed*), collects the current segments the same way and calls `importTranslations()`. `ok` results (and `source_changed` with *include changed*) are saved in one `updateEntity()` per job with the API translation's rules (plain text over `maxLength` is not saved and named); `untranslated`, `invalid_markup` and `missing` are only counted. *Kept* counts the file's keys whose field got a target text since the export (left alone without *overwrite*).
- **Reference** of a job: `<Entity>:<id>:<source language>:<target language>`, e.g. `Product:6650a1b2c3d4e5f60:en_US:de_CH` (AtroCore entity name, record id and language codes, never titles; `TranslationFileExchange::reference()` / `parseReference()`). The source language is part of it because an action may translate from another language than the main one.
- **Languages in the file:** `sourceLanguage`/`targetLanguage` are the Supertext codes of the connection's mapping (`Settings::sourceCode()` / `languageCode()`); a language without one is written as its AtroCore code with `-` (`xx_YY` → `xx-YY`), so a language without a Supertext language never blocks the export.
- **File names:** `atropim-<entity>-<id>-<language>.xlf` / `.html`, `atropim-<entity>-<id>.xlf` for several languages; `Content-Type` `application/x-xliff+xml` / `text/html; charset=utf-8`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- **AtroCore glue:** `AtroRecordSource` (the `RecordSource` interface) loads through the record service (`getEntity()`: read ACL), checks `acl->check($entity, 'edit')` and saves with `updateEntity()` (ACL, validation, hooks, history; `NotModified` is success), with the same field definitions as `EntityTranslator` (attribute value fields from the loaded entity).
- **UI:** AtroCore has no per-record UI hook a module can add a dialog to without its own front end, so the files ride on its action framework: the action types `supertextExport` and `supertextImport` (handlers `POST /api/Action/{id}/supertextExport|supertextImport`, no `…Async`: a download can't run in the background). `SupertextExport::execute()` builds the file once (so *Nothing to translate.* and the like come back as the action's error) and `ActionService::afterExecuteNow` puts `link` = `api/supertext/export?entity=…&id=…&targets=…&format=…` into the result, which AtroCore's front end opens with `window.open()` (`executeActionRequest` in `client/src/views/record/detail.js` and `list.js`); the browser's AtroCore session cookies (`auth-username`, `auth-token`, accepted by `AuthMiddleware`) authenticate it. `SupertextImport` links to `api/supertext/import`, a self-contained server-rendered page (`ImportPage`, strings in `Action.json` → `messages` → `supertextFile…`) that posts `multipart/form-data` to itself and shows the summary. A cookie-authenticated POST must carry the form token `sha256("supertext-import|" + auth-token cookie)` (other sites can't read the cookie); header-authenticated API calls need none. `Accept: application/json` gets the summary as JSON.
- **Routes:** `ExportHandler` (`GET /supertext/export`) and `ImportHandler` (`GET`/`POST /supertext/import`), `#[Route]` with `skipActionHistory` (no request bodies in the action history). AtroCore validates requests and responses against the attribute (league/openapi-psr7-validator): the success content types are declared; the import has no `requestBody` (the validator would try to parse the multipart body), errors have no content schema.
- **Uploads** are read from the PSR-7 uploaded file in memory (size checked first, `UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE` reported as too large) and never written anywhere.
- **Console:** `supertext export <Entity> <id> [languages] [--format=xliff|html] [--source=…] [--overwrite] [--output=<file>]` and `supertext import <file> [--include-changed] [--overwrite]`, as the system user, English summary.
- `tests/demo-check.sh` exports a product as the editor through the REST API, fills one `<target>`, imports it and checks the stored value, the 403 for a missing form token and the upload page.

## Supertext Plugin Health

[Supertext Plugin Health](https://github.com/Supertext/Commando-Center-Supertext-Translation/tree/main/plugin-health) is the dependency-free library every Supertext plugin uses for the version reports, the report of the API key check's result and the answer of the ping endpoint (see *Commando Center*); the key check itself is the SDK's. It lives in the Commando Center's repository (`plugin-health/`). The module ships a copy of its PHP part in `lib/supertext-plugin-health/` with its namespace changed from `Supertext\PluginHealth` to `SupertextTranslation\PluginHealth`, autoloaded like the SDK's copy (`composer.json`, `tests/bootstrap.php`, `tests/phpstan-bootstrap.php`). `COMMIT` and `VERSION` there name the revision.

- Never edit `lib/supertext-plugin-health/`. Fix it in Commando-Center-Supertext-Translation/plugin-health (all five languages, see its README), then run `scripts/vendor-plugin-health.sh <tag>` (e.g. `plugin-health-v0.1.0`; default `main`; `PLUGIN_HEALTH_DIR=/path/to/clone` uses a local clone as it is) and the tests.

## Language codes

Supertext accepts only the codes of `GET features` (the SDK's `Languages::TARGETS` / `SOURCES`): targets are regional only for German, English, French, Italian and Portuguese (`de-CH`, `en-US`, `pt-BR`), a script for Chinese and Serbian (`zh-Hans`, `sr-Latn`), a dialect for Swiss German (`gsw-u-sd-chzh`), and **bare for all others** (`es`, `nl`, `sl`, …); sources are bare (`en`). The old default regions (`es-ES`, `sl-SI`, `zh-CN`) are rejected by the live API; since SDK 0.4.0 only the SDK's obvious defaults apply (below).

`Settings::languageCode()` / `sourceCode()` (no AtroCore classes, `tests/unit/SettingsTest.php`) resolve every AtroCore language with `Languages::target($code, $mapping)` / `Languages::source($code, $mapping)`, using **one** mapping for both: the connection's combo boxes win (`LanguageMapping::fromData()`; only Supertext's codes count), then lines of the old text field `supertextLanguageCodes` (`"de_DE = de-CH"`), else an exact match (case and `_`/`-` ignored: `de_CH` → `de-CH`, `en_US` → source `en`), else (targets only, since SDK 0.4.0) the SDK's default (`de` → `de-DE`, `zh_CN` → `zh-Hans`, `es_ES` → `es`, `nl_NL` → `nl`; nothing for `de_LI`, `en_IE`, `fr_BE`, `sr_RS`), else `unsupported_language` (a `SupertextException` with key `unsupported_language` and `{language}`; nothing is sent). A chosen target is sent in its source form when the language is the source (`de-CH` for `de_DE` → source `de`, since SDK 0.2.1). A line of the old text field with a value that isn't in the SDK's list is sent as entered (the combo boxes only offer the list).

**The combo boxes** (`LanguageMapping`): `Listeners\Metadata` adds one Connection field per AtroCore language (main language and `inputLanguageList`, `ConnectionStatus::languages()`): `supertextCode` + the code in AtroCore's camel case (`de_DE` → `supertextCodeDeDe`, like AtroCore's multilingual fields), type `enum`, `notStorable` + `dataField` (stored in the connection's `data` JSON like the other settings), options `""` and `Languages::targetOptions()` (sorted by name), `default` `Languages::suggestTarget()` (so a new connection starts preselected). `Listeners\Language` labels them for every interface language: *Supertext language for German (de_DE)* (the language's name from AtroCore's languages), the tooltip, `""` as *— choose —* and each code as "Name (code)" (the SDK's English name; other interface languages use PHP's `Locale::getDisplayName()` where `intl` is installed, except the Swiss German dialects). `Listeners\ConnectionLayout` puts one row per language between the timeout and *Send version information*. On read, an empty combo box shows `suggestTarget()` (not saved: an empty one is translated with the same code). On save, `ConnectionService` refuses values outside the list with a `BadRequest` (AtroCore's own enum validation would too); `Settings` ignores them anyway.

**Migration of the old text field** (`LanguageMapping::migrate()`, on every read and save of a Supertext connection, saved with `skipAll`): a line for one of the languages whose combo box has never been saved becomes its value (in Supertext's spelling) if Supertext lists the code; a line for a language whose combo box exists is dropped (the combo box wins); lines for other languages or with unlisted codes stay in `supertextLanguageCodes`, which `Settings` still reads. So nothing configured is lost and the resolved codes don't change (`LanguageMappingTest`).

`EntityTranslator` resolves the source once (a source without a Supertext language fails the whole run) and each target in its loop (such a target fails only that language). Formal/informal is sent only where `Languages::supportsPoliteness($target)` isn't `false`; otherwise the language is translated with the default tone and its result carries `supertextPolitenessSkipped`, so the setting is never dropped silently. `Settings::languageStatus()` builds the connection's read-only **Languages** field (code, *no Supertext language*, *no formal/informal tone*, *not in the list*) and the `supertext check` output.

The demo's languages (`en_US`, `de_CH`, `fr_CH`, `it_CH`) are exact Supertext codes, so their combo boxes are preselected and need no choice; `tests/demo-check.sh` checks the preselection, the options, a refused value, a changed choice and the migration of an old line. The stand-in (`tests/docs/stand-in.mjs`) accepts only Supertext's codes, like the real API.

## Commando Center

Every Supertext plugin reports to the Supertext Commando Center (protocol: Commando-Center-Supertext-Translation → `docs/DEVELOPER.md` → *Report protocol*). The protocol is [Supertext Plugin Health](#supertext-plugin-health)'s `InstallationReporter`, with the SDK's `checkApiKey()` and `Protocol::apiKeyFingerprint()` as its key checker (`CallableKeyChecker`) and `Supertext::SDK_VERSION` as `sdk_version`; the module only supplies what AtroCore knows:

- `app/Translation/Reporting.php` (no AtroCore classes, `tests/unit/ReportingTest.php`): builds the reporter (`plugin.name` = `AtroPIM-Supertext-Translation`, the GitHub repository name), wraps every call so nothing ever throws, keeps the state through two closures (`ReportTransport` lets a test's SDK transport carry the reports too; without one, the key check uses the SDK's curl and the report Plugin Health's), and builds the texts of the read-only **API key check** field (the center's messages in en/de/fr/it, `Action.json` → `messages` → `supertextKeyCheck…`, with the bare URLs since the field is plain text).
- `app/Translation/ReportingFactory.php` (AtroCore glue): `siteUrl` = AtroCore's `siteUrl` (the request's host if empty), `plugin.version` = the module's Composer version (`moduleManager->getModule('SupertextTranslation')->getVersion()`, the same source *Updates & Modules* and `supertext check` show), `system` = `AtroPIM` and the Pim module's version (`AtroCore` and `SoftwarePackage::getCoreVersion()` without AtroPIM), runtime PHP. `callbackUrl` = `<siteUrl>/api/supertext/ping`. The API base URL of the key check is the connection's (so `SUPERTEXT_API_URL` and *Staging* apply).
- **State:** AtroCore's config file (`data/config.php`, key `supertextReporter`, the reporter's JSON as it is, the same JSON the SDK 0.1–0.2 reporter stored, so sites keep their history (no new `installed` report); written only when it changed, through `Config::save()`, which merges only the changed key). `Settings::getConfigData()` never sends it to the browser (only declared settings fields). It holds the key's SHA-256 fingerprint, never the key.
- **Setting:** `supertextVersionReports` on the connection (null = never saved = on), combined with `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS` by `InstallationReporter::reportsEnabled()`. With several connections, the one saved or used counts; the ping follows the first connection.

When the reporter runs:

| Moment | Where | Reporter call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection created or saved | `ConnectionService::afterCreateEntity` / `afterUpdateEntity` | `afterSettingsSaved` (result stored in the read-only field) |
| Connection shown | `ConnectionService::afterReadEntity` | `onRequest`, after the response (`ReportingFactory::defer()`) |
| *Test connection* | `ConnectionSupertext::testConnection` | `testConnection`; anything but `ok` is shown as the error |
| A translation (action, mass action, job, `supertext translate`) | `EntityTranslator::translate` → `ReportingFactory::afterTranslation()` | once per process, at its end: `authenticationFailed` if Supertext answered 401/403 (`markAuthenticationFailed()`), else `onRequest` |
| `supertext check` | `Console\Check` | `testConnection`, then `reportCheck` |

`defer()` registers a shutdown function that first ends the response (`fastcgi_finish_request()` under PHP-FPM; under mod_php it flushes the output and runs right after), so reports never delay or fail the work. Front-end requests never run it (AtroCore has none that run the module).

**Ping endpoint:** `app/Handlers/Supertext/PingHandler.php`, `#[Route(path: '/supertext/ping', methods: ['GET'], auth: false, skipActionHistory: true)]` → `GET /api/supertext/ping`. AtroCore's `AuthMiddleware` lets it through without credentials (`useNoAuth()`), no session, no CSRF; the API has no page cache. It answers `InstallationReporter::pingResponse()` exactly (status, headers, body as a Guzzle PSR-7 response); the 200, 400 and 404 answers are declared in the route attribute because AtroCore validates responses against it.

## Local development

The quickest setup is the demo image (below), which installs AtroPIM with the module. To work on the module in your own AtroCore project, add this repository as a Composer path repository and run AtroCore's update:

```json
"repositories": [{"type": "path", "url": "/path/to/AtroPIM-Supertext-Translation", "options": {"symlink": true}}]
```

```bash
php atrocore-installer.phar require supertext/atropim-supertext-translation:@dev
php console.php "clear cache"     # after changing metadata, layouts or listeners
```

New fields in `entityDefs` get their database columns from AtroCore's schema diff (`php console.php "sql diff --run"`; the installer's update runs it).

## Tests

```bash
phpunit                                                   # PHPUnit 11, no AtroCore needed
find app tests demo -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l
```

The unit tests cover the SDK wrapper (protocol, errors, segments, splitting into several documents), the planner, the settings and the language mapping (the combo boxes' definitions, labels, rows, the server-side check and the migration of the old text field; no guessing beyond the SDK's defaults, languages without a Supertext language, the **Languages** field), the reporting (each reporter call, state storage, a state stored by the SDK 0.2 reporter, off by setting or environment, the hour after a failed report, the ping answers, the key check texts; against a fake transport, never the live API or center), the translation files (`TranslationFileExchangeTest`: reference round trip, export with the collector's keys and the mapping, HTML with one language, nothing to translate, import with another plugin, an unknown reference or language, a record that isn't editable, `ok` written, `source_changed` only with the option, `untranslated`/`invalid_markup`/`missing` never written, kept fields, `maxLength`, a rejected save, files too large or invalid, the upload page and its form token), the console arguments and the interface languages (`InterfaceLanguagesTest`: the same keys, placeholders and links in all four languages, and an English text for every message key the code uses). `tests/demo-check.sh` is the end-to-end test: it starts the demo image twice against MySQL with the stand-in API (`tests/docs/stand-in.mjs`), checks the demo accounts, translates a product with the console command and the other one with the REST API as the editor, and checks the stored values; it also checks `supertext check`, the reports the stand-in received as Commando Center (`SUPERTEXT_REPORT_URL`: `installed` and `check`, plugin, system, site URL, callback, key check, never the key) and the public ping endpoint (200 with the challenge, 400, `Cache-Control: no-store`). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs both (lint and unit tests on PHP 8.4 and 8.5), plus PHPStan (see *Code quality and security checks*).

## Demo (Railway)

`demo/` builds one image (`demo/Dockerfile`, build context = repository root; `railway.json` points Railway at it): PHP 8.4 + Apache with AtroCore 2.4.7, AtroPIM 1.16.10 and this module, plus AtroCore's job runner (`console.php cron` every minute). MySQL is a separate service.

On every start `demo/docker/entrypoint.sh`:

1. links `data/` and `upload/` to the volume at `/data` (AtroCore keeps its configuration, languages and the encryption key of connection passwords in `data/`, so without a volume a restart forgets them) and refreshes the module list and cache from the image;
2. `install.php`: creates the database `ATROPIM_DB_NAME` on the MySQL server if needed and installs AtroPIM on the first start, with `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` as administrator (the installer empties that database, so it refuses `railway` and other shared names);
3. `sql diff --run` for columns of newer module versions;
4. `setup.php model`: the languages German, French and Italian (Switzerland) and the multilingual product attribute *Tasting notes*;
5. `setup.php content`: two sample products, the Supertext connection (no key: it uses `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY`), the action *Translate with Supertext* for products (*Execute as: Same user*), the role *Product editor (Supertext demo)* and the `DEMO_*` accounts.

Everything is created only if missing; existing records and accounts are never changed. Step 4 and 5 are separate processes because new languages and attributes change the metadata the next step needs.

| Variable | |
| --- | --- |
| `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Administrator (user name = e-mail). Replaces AtroCore's installation screen: with `DEMO_*` set, it never appears. |
| `DEMO_EDITOR_EMAIL`, `DEMO_EDITOR_PASSWORD` | Role *Product editor (Supertext demo)*: reads and edits products (attribute values included) in every language, reads categories, brands, attributes, files and actions. AtroCore has no editor role out of the box. |
| `MYSQL_URL` | `mysql://user:password@host:3306/…`; the database name in the URL is ignored. Railway: `mysql://root:${{MySQL-8.MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}}@mysql8.railway.internal:3306/railway`. |
| `ATROPIM_DB_NAME` | The demo's own database (default `atropim`). |
| `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` | The Supertext key the demo's connection falls back to. |
| `SUPERTEXT_API_URL` | Only for tests against the stand-in. |
| `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS` | `0` turns the Commando Center reports off (default on: the demo reports like any installation). |
| `SUPERTEXT_REPORT_URL` | Only for tests: where reports go instead of the Commando Center (the stand-in: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/report`). |
| `DEMO_SITE_URL` | Public URL, if it isn't `https://$RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`. |
| `PORT` | Set by Railway (default 8080). |

Passwords must meet AtroCore's rule (at least 8 characters with an upper-case letter, a digit and a special character); otherwise that account is skipped with a warning and the demo still starts. The log names variables, never values. Values live only in Railway's variables; `demo/.env.example` lists them.

Railway: project *supertext-cms-demos-php*, service *AtroPIM* (volume `atropim-data` at `/data`), database `atropim` on the shared *MySQL-8* service, <https://atropim-production.up.railway.app/>. Pushes to `main` deploy. The `DEMO_*` and `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` variables reference the *Contao* service's; `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is `${{Contao.DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD}}-A1`, because the shared password doesn't meet AtroCore's password rule. The first start takes about ten minutes (each new language rebuilds AtroCore's schema).

Locally:

```bash
docker build -f demo/Dockerfile -t supertext-atropim-demo .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file demo/.env -v atropim-data:/data supertext-atropim-demo
# http://localhost:8080 (the first start installs AtroPIM: about a minute)
docker exec <container> demo-console supertext check
```

## Docs screenshots

`tests/docs/screenshots.mjs` (Playwright) regenerates `docs/images/` from a **fresh** demo (no translations yet) whose `SUPERTEXT_API_URL` points at `tests/docs/stand-in.mjs`. The stand-in answers like the Supertext API and returns real German, French and Italian translations of the sample content (`tests/docs/samples.json`; new demo content needs entries there), so the guides never show placeholder text.

```bash
cd tests/docs && npm install
node stand-in.mjs &
# a fresh demo with SUPERTEXT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/, SUPERTEXT_REPORT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765/report
# (the stand-in also answers reports, so screenshots never report to the live center) and DEMO_* set, on port 8095
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8095 DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL=… DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… DEMO_EDITOR_EMAIL=… DEMO_EDITOR_PASSWORD=… node screenshots.mjs
```

The images are 1× and cropped to the relevant part. The connection's API URL isn't shown (the demo's connection is set to *Live*; the stand-in comes from the environment variable).

## Code quality and security checks

- **Checks** (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`): actionlint and zizmor lint the workflows on every push and pull request; dependency review fails a pull request that adds a package with a known vulnerability (moderate or worse). Third-party actions are pinned to commit SHAs (Dependabot keeps them current). Run the linters locally with `pip install actionlint-py zizmor`, then `actionlint` and `zizmor .github/workflows`.
- **Links** (`.github/workflows/links.yml`): lychee checks the links in all Markdown files weekly and whenever docs change on `main`. Broken links open (or update) the issue "Broken links in the docs". Links that can't work from CI (local addresses, pages behind a login, placeholders) are excluded in `.lycheeignore`.
- **PHPStan** (job `phpstan` in `ci.yml`, configuration in `phpstan.neon`): level 5 on `app/`. PHPStan needs AtroCore's classes, so the job installs AtroPIM from `demo/project/composer.json` (without scripts) and loads its autoloader through `tests/phpstan-bootstrap.php`. Locally, point `ATRO_VENDOR` at the `vendor/` folder of an AtroCore 2.4 / AtroPIM 1.16 installation: `ATRO_VENDOR=/path/to/atro/vendor phpstan analyse` (PHPStan 2.x, e.g. the `phpstan.phar` from its GitHub releases). Existing findings that aren't fixed yet are listed in `phpstan-baseline.neon` (regenerate with `phpstan analyse --generate-baseline` after fixing some); new code must not add any.
- **GitHub settings** (set by Remy's setup script, not in the repo): secret scanning with push protection (a push containing a known token format is rejected; findings under *Security → Secret scanning*) and CodeQL default setup (findings under *Security → Code scanning* and as pull request comments). CodeQL doesn't cover PHP, which is why this repo runs PHPStan.
- `.github/workflows/support-triage.yml`: support requests from the Supertext integrations website arrive as issues labelled `support` (contact details stay in the Supertext CMS). Claude classifies each one: answers questions (marked `<!-- supertext:reply -->`, emailed to the sender by the CMS) and closes them, fixes bugs as pull requests for review (never merged automatically), labels feature requests `feature-request`. Only people with triage rights can add labels, so outsiders can't start it. Needs the organisation secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; the workflow is the same in every Supertext repo.

Before starting work in this repo, look at its open findings: code scanning alerts, secret scanning alerts, Dependabot pull requests and the issue "Broken links in the docs".

## Releasing

Releases are published by `.github/workflows/release.yml` when the version is officially bumped; nobody tags or creates releases by hand.

1. Move the *Unreleased* entries in `CHANGELOG.md` under a new `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` section, and keep an empty *Unreleased* above it.
2. There is no version field to change: Composer takes the version from the Git tag the workflow creates (don't add `version` to `composer.json`). AtroCore shows it under *Administration → Updates & Modules* (from Composer's lock file); `supertext check` prints it and links X.Y.Z versions to their GitHub release.
3. Push to `main`. The workflow tags `vX.Y.Z` and creates the GitHub release with the CHANGELOG section as notes (0.x versions as pre-releases). A push that adds no new version does nothing, and a version that is already released is skipped. After fixing a failed run, start it again with *Run workflow* on the *Release* workflow.

## Conventions

- PSR-12, PHP 8.4 (and 8.5), strict types; keep `app/Api/`, `Planner`, `TextUnit`, `Settings`, `Messages`, `Reporting` and `CommandArguments` free of AtroCore classes (the unit tests run without AtroCore).
- Interface languages: every label, tooltip, option and message goes into all four `i18n` folders (`en_US`, `de_DE`, `fr_FR`, `it_IT`) in the same commit. Formal address (Sie, vous, Lei), AtroCore's own terms in each language (e.g. *Verwaltung → Verbindungen*, *Administration → Connexions*, *Amministrazione → Connessioni*, *enregistrement*, *action de masse*), and never translate "Supertext", `{placeholders}` or URLs. New messages: a snake_case key (`$messages->text('no_text')`) whose text is `messages` → `supertextNoText` in `Action.json`.
- New action or connection options: `entityDefs/Action.json` or `Connection.json`, the layout listener, all four `i18n` folders (label, tooltip, options) **and** the settings tables in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md#settings).
- The module id `SupertextTranslation`, the action type `supertextTranslate`, the connection type `supertext` and the field names `supertext*` are stored in users' databases; renaming them is a breaking change.
- Keep the three docs in `docs/` current with every change (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Known limitations / roadmap

- Each run translates one record per language request; a mass action over many records takes a while (use *Execute in background*).
- Only multilingual text fields. Not yet: option labels of list fields, file names and descriptions, translatable labels of AtroCore's metadata.
- Source and target languages are set per action, not chosen by the editor when clicking (also for *Export for translation*: one action per language set or format).
- *Export for translation* exports one record per click (no mass export into one file yet).
- The language mapping's combo boxes follow AtroCore's languages: a language added under *Administration → Languages* gets its combo box after the metadata cache is rebuilt (AtroCore does that when languages change); a removed language's saved choice stays in the connection's `data` unused.
- Not on a package registry yet (installed from GitHub).
- Human (professional) translation orders are not supported yet (the WordPress plugin has them).
